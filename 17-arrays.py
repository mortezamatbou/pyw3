# -- Python arrays --
# ::NOTE:: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp

# ::NOTE:: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however,
# to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.

# Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:
# Create an array containing car names:
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
print(cars)

# An array is a contiguous chunk of memory with a fixed size whereas a list is typically implemented
# as individual elements linked to each other via pointers and does not have a fixed size
