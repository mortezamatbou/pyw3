# Multi Line Comments
# Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
print("Hello, Mori!")

# Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
# Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable
# You can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it
