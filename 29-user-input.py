# -- Python User Input --

# The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
# Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
# Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

# in Python 3.6
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Your name is:", name)

# in Python 2.7
# username = raw_input("Enter username:")
# print("Username is: " + username)

# Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues when the user has given some input.
